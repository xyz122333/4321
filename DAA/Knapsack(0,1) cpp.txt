/*
Follow the below steps to solve the problem:

The maximum value obtained from ‘N’ items is the max of the following two values. 

1. Case 1 (include the Nth item): Value of the Nth item plus maximum value obtained by remaining N-1 items and remaining weight i.e. (W-weight of the Nth item).
2. Case 2 (exclude the Nth item): Maximum value obtained by N-1 items and W weight.
3. If the weight of the ‘Nth‘ item is greater than ‘W’, then the Nth item cannot be included and Case 2 is the only possibility.
